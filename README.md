## Chapter Organization

### Metadata-Driven Chapters

Use YAML frontmatter to organize your chapters:

```yaml
---
chapter: 5.2
title: 'The Forest Encounter'
status: draft
---
# The Forest Encounter

Your chapter content here...
```

- **Decimal Numbering**: Use chapter numbers like `1`, `5.1`, `5.3.2` to split long chapters
- **Metadata Titles**: Chapter titles come from YAML `title` field, not filenames
- **Smart Sorting**: Chapters sort correctly (5.2 comes before 5.10)
- **Display Format**: Shows as `5.2 - The Forest Encounter` in structure panel

### File Organization

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ Book/                    # All story content goes here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter-1.md        # Any filename works
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter-5-1.md      # Metadata determines display
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Part2/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Chapter-10.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Characters/             # Character cards (optional)

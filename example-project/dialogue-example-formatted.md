# Chapter 1: The Meeting

The old library was quiet except for the soft whisper of turning pages. @Elene walked between the towering shelves, her fingers trailing along the worn spines of countless books.

    "Are you looking for something specific?" asked the librarian, appearing suddenly from behind a cart of returned books.

    "Just browsing," @Elene replied, though her eyes were searching for something particular. She had heard rumors about a hidden section, books that weren't meant for ordinary readers.

The librarian studied her for a moment. "You have the look of someone who reads between the lines."

    "What do you mean by that?"

    "Some books reveal their secrets only to those who know how to look." He gestured toward a narrow corridor she hadn't noticed before. "The restricted section is through there, but..."

    "But what?"

    "But some knowledge comes with a price."

@Elene felt her heart quicken. This was exactly what she had hoped to find.

The restricted section was dimmer than the main library, lit only by a few scattered lamps. Ancient volumes lined the walls, their leather bindings cracked with age.

    "These books," the librarian whispered, "contain stories that were never meant to be told."

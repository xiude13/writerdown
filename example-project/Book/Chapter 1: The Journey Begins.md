# Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

@Elene stood at the edge of the cliff, watching the sun set over the valley below. [[She's been searching for her brother for months]]

The wind carried whispers of ancient magic. {{TODO: Add more sensory details about the magical atmosphere}}

#! [EVENT] Intro

> "I will find you, @[Marcus The Knight]," she whispered to herself. {{EDIT: Make this more emotional and impactful}}

**_ SCENE 2: The Village _**

[PLOT: Elena discovers the first clue about her brother's whereabouts in this village]

The old man @Garry at the tavern had **weathered hands** and _knowing eyes_. [[This character becomes important later]]

"Your brother @[Marcus The Knight]," he said, "he went north. To the _Whispering Woods_." {{RESEARCH: Check mythology about whispering woods}}

@Garry leaned closer. "But beware, young @Elene. The woods change those who enter." [[Foreshadowing]]

### Writer's Notes

- Character development: @Elene needs more backstory
- @[Marcus The Knight] backstory: What drove him to the woods?
- @Garry's role: Guardian of secrets, knows more than he reveals
- Setting: The village represents safety before danger
- Themes: Family bonds, perseverance, magic vs reality

Conversations drifted through the hazeâ€”fragments of boasting, negotiations for flesh, the nervous laughter of the young @[Lord Halven].

{{TODO: Add interaction between @Elene and @Garry}}

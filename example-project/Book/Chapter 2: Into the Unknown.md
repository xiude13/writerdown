## Chapter 2: Into the Unknown

**_ SCENE 3: The Forest _**

#! [EVENT] The Forest

#! [ACTION] The Forest

@Elene entered the **Whispering Woods** just as the first stars appeared. [[The woods are alive with ancient magic]]

She thought of @[Marcus The Knight], wondering "if he had walked this same path". @Garry's warnings echoed in her mind. @Bran is not going to happy about this.

- Pack supplies: bread, water, rope, don't forget @Bran
- Magic items: crystal pendant [[reminds her of @[Marcus The Knight]]], map
- Weapons: silver dagger [[inherited from grandmother]]

> The trees seemed to lean in, listening to her footsteps.

{{EDIT: This description feels too generic. Make it more unique and atmospheric.}}

[PLOT: The woods test travelers - only those with pure intentions can pass through safely]

**_ SCENE 4: The Encounter _**

A figure emerged from the shadows. @Elene raised her dagger, but the stranger raised empty hands.

"Peace, @Elene. I am @Thane, guardian of these woods. Your brother @[Marcus The Knight]... he passed this way."

@Thane's eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. [[He's not entirely human]]

"@[Marcus The Knight] seeks the _Heart of the Forest_," @Thane continued. "But the price... @Elene, you must understand the price."

@Bran's hand jerked away from his belt. His mouth opened, closed, opened again. "How could you possibly know that?"

#! [EVENT] The Schools

{{TODO: Develop @Thane's character - ally or antagonist?}}

[PLOT: @Thane knows about the family curse that binds @Elene and @[Marcus The Knight]]

<h1>Chapter 1: The Meeting</h1>

<p>The old library was quiet except for the soft whisper of turning pages. @Elena walked between the towering shelves, her fingers trailing along the worn spines of countless books.</p>

<p class="dialogue">"Are you looking for something specific?" asked the librarian, appearing suddenly from behind a cart of returned books.</p>

<p class="dialogue">"Just browsing," @Elena replied, though her eyes were searching for something particular. She had heard rumors about a hidden section, books that weren't meant for ordinary readers.</p>

<p>The librarian studied her for a moment. "You have the look of someone who reads between the lines."</p>

<p class="dialogue">"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p class="dialogue">"Some books reveal their secrets only to those who know how to look." He gestured toward a narrow corridor she hadn't noticed before. "The restricted section is through there, but..."</p>

<p class="dialogue">"But what?"</p>

<p class="dialogue">"But some knowledge comes with a price."</p>

<p>@Elena felt her heart quicken. This was exactly what she had hoped to find.</p>

<p>                    * * *</p>

<p>The restricted section was dimmer than the main library, lit only by a few scattered lamps. Ancient volumes lined the walls, their leather bindings cracked with age.</p>

<p class="dialogue">"These books," the librarian whispered, "contain stories that were never meant to be told."</p>

<p>{{TODO: Develop the mystery around the restricted books}}</p>

<p>{{RESEARCH: Historical libraries with restricted sections}}</p>

<h3>Writer's Notes</h3>

<p>This scene establishes the mysterious atmosphere and introduces the concept of forbidden knowledge. The dialogue should feel natural while building tension.</p>

# WriterDown Development Guide

## Running the Extension

### Method 1: Debug Mode (Recommended for Development)

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` or go to Run â†’ Start Debugging
3. This opens a new VS Code window with the extension loaded
4. Open your writing project in the new window

### Method 2: Install as VSIX Package

1. Build the extension: `npm run build`
2. Install the generated `.vsix` file:
   - Command Palette â†’ "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
   - Select the `writerdown-0.0.1.vsix` file
3. Reload VS Code

### Method 3: Development Install

```bash
# Link the extension for development
npm install -g vsce
vsce package
code --install-extension writerdown-0.0.1.vsix
```

## Troubleshooting

### "There is no data provider registered" Error

This usually happens when the extension isn't properly loaded. Try:

1. **Reload VS Code Window**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Check Extension is Active**: Look for WriterDown in the activity bar (book icon)
3. **Run Debug Command**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "WriterDown: Debug Structure Provider"
4. **Check Console**: Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools â†’ Console tab

### Character Tree Issues

- **Double-click not working**: Make sure you're double-clicking the character name, not the expand arrow
- **Categories not showing**: Ensure character cards have YAML frontmatter with `category` field
- **No characters detected**: Check that you're using `@CharacterName` syntax in your markdown files

### Structure Tree Issues

- **No structure showing**: Ensure you have a `Book/` folder with `.md` files
- **Files not detected**: Check that files contain markdown headers (`# Title`, `## Chapter`, etc.)
- **Nested folders not working**: Verify folder structure follows the pattern `Book/Act I/Chapter 1.md`

## File Structure Requirements

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ Book/                          # Required: All story content goes here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter-01.md             # Direct chapters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Act I - The Beginning/    # Nested structure supported
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter 1.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Chapter 2.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Act II/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Chapter 3.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .characters/                   # Auto-generated character cards
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Elena.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Marcus.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Thane.md
â””â”€â”€ other-files.md                # Other files (ignored by structure)
```

## Character Card YAML Format

```yaml

role: Main Character               # Character's story role
importance: major                  # major | minor | supporting
faction: Rebels                    # Character's allegiance
location: Capital City             # Primary location
status: active                     # active | inactive | deceased
tags: [brave, intelligent, loyal] # Flexible tags
